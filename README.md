# Carbon-emissions-database-creation
Carbon-dioxide is the most commonly occurring gas in the atmosphere. Due to the increase in anthropogenic activities, there is an imbalance in nature and human activities. Carbon-dioxide emissions have become the primary source for this imbalance and a shift in global climate cycle. Countries all around the globe are taking initiatives to become carbon-negative. Technologies are being developed for carbon capture and sequestration. Thus, it has become all the more important to monitor this activity now than ever. This study involves creating a database for CO2 emissions for every state in the United States of America over the span of 3 decades from 1980 to 2017. The database helps in analysing the carbon intensity, energy related emissions and carbon intensity change with the change in economy.
